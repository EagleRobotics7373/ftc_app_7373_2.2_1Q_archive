 * Created by Jordan Moss on 10/9/2016.
 *
 * This class has one constructor Shooter which has 2 paramters for the left and right motor
 *
 * This class has 4 methods
 *
 * powerRun has 1 arg power which is a float that run the shooter to a set power value
 *
 * rpmRun has 1 arg rpm which is an integer that runs the shooter at a specific RPM
 *
 * rpmLeft has no args and returns the currents rpm of the left motor as an int
 * rpmRight has no args and returns the current rpm of the right motor as an int
